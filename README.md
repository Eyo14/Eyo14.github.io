Hi! I know you love how to cook your favorite food, but do you know the safety in cooking? Imagine you cook a meal for yourself. While you are cooking, there is something suspicious in the gas and it blow up your cooking. You panic and get an extinguisher to remove the fire. You realize that the gas fire was too strong so that's why it blow up. You have to pay your bills because the kitchen went burned. This is why we should be more careful in cooking food. Cooking is easy for you, but you don't know the safety and procedures in cooking. If you don't know what to do, I will help you on how to cook with safety to understand it. 

## How to cook your own food with SAFETY
You need to remember them. You can't just cook your own food without proper ways in cooking. We have 5 things to know:                                                    
Cook your food properly to at least 75 °C or hotter.                                                                                                                    

Roll up sleeves before cooking. Loose-fitting clothing can catch on fire.                                                                                             

Designate a “kids-free zone” that is at least 3 feet away from the stove.                                                                                               

Only use microwave-safe containers to heat things in the microwave.                                                                                                

If a smoke alarm sounds during normal cooking, open a door or fan the area. Do not disable the smoke alarm or take out the batteries.
